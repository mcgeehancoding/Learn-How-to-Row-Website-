							<p>What is Rowing?</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Rowing, referred to as crew in much of the United States, is a sport that can be traced back to Ancient Egyptian times. It is based on propelling a boat or racing shell on water using oars. The participants are able to move the boat by pushing against the water with an oar, which causes a force to be generated and move the boat further down the river. The sport can be either recreational, where the focus is on learning the technique of rowing, or competitive, where athletes race against each other in boats. There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete, ranging from an individual shell called a single scull to an eight-person shell with a coxswain called a coxed eight.</p>
